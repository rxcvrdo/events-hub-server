Events Hub
Events Hub is a dynamic events platform backend built using Node.js and Express. It provides a robust API for managing user authentication, event creation, and payment processing. The application integrates MongoDB for data persistence and utilizes Stripe for secure payment transactions.

Features
User Authentication: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and password hashing with bcryptjs.

Event Management: Create, update, and list events.

Payment Integration: Handle payments with Stripe.

Middleware: Utilize cookie-parser for cookie management and CORS for cross-origin resource sharing.

Environment Configurations: Manage environment variables with dotenv.

Development Tools: Use Nodemon for efficient development with automatic restarts.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express: Web framework for building APIs.

MongoDB & Mongoose: NoSQL database and ODM for data management.

JWT: For secure token-based authentication.

bcryptjs: For hashing passwords.

Stripe: Payment processing.

cookie-parser & CORS: For request handling and cross-origin support.

dotenv: To manage environment variables.

Nodemon: For automatic server restarts during development.
